    "## Main ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-regularized (un)balanced Optimal Transport (OT) is defined as the following optimization \n",
    "problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathrm{OT}_{\\varphi}(\\alpha,\\beta) = \\min_\\pi \\iint c(x,y) \\mathrm{d}\\pi + D_\\varphi(\\pi_1|\\alpha) + D_\\varphi(\\pi_2|\\beta), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c$ is the cost function of our problem (in the current implementation $c(x,y) = \\|x-y\\|^2$, other costs will be \n",
    "added in the future), and $D_\\varphi$ is a divergence to the marginal (e.g. the Kullback-Leibler divergence) which \n",
    "depends on the choice of an entropy function $\\varphi$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is **homogeneous** with respect to the couple of input measures $(\\alpha,\\beta)$, that is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathrm{OT}_{\\varphi}(\\lambda \\alpha, \\lambda \\beta) = \\lambda \\cdot \\mathrm{OT}_{\\varphi}(\\alpha,\\beta), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and (probably more importantly) if $\\pi$ is a optimal for the couple $(\\alpha,\\beta)$, then $\\lambda \\pi$ is optimal for \n",
    "the couple $(\\lambda \\alpha,\\lambda \\beta)$. \n",
    "This is a suitable behavior: rescaling the measures (e.g. changing the unit of measurment) should not change the \n",
    "structure of the solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, adding the celebrated entropic regularization term $+\\epsilon \\mathrm{KL}(\\pi | \\alpha \\otimes \\beta)$ \n",
    "may break homogeneity in some situations. \n",
    "Interestingly, when considering either\n",
    "- Balanced optimal transport ($D_\\varphi(\\mu | \\nu) = 0$ if $\\mu=\\nu$, $+\\infty$ otherwise),\n",
    "- KL divergence to the marginal ($D_\\varphi = \\mathrm{KL}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "the objective value $\\mathrm{OT}_{\\epsilon,\\varphi}$ is **not** homogeneous, but the optimal transport plans are \n",
    "homogeneous: the sturcture of the solutions is preserved. \n",
    "Furthermore, the so-called Sinkhorn divergence is also homogeneous. \n",
    "\n",
    "This does not hold for more general divergences though. For instance, using $D_\\varphi = \\mathrm{TV}$ the *Total Variation* \n",
    "yields inhomogeneity. \n",
    "This is even worse when considering spatially varying divergences as the one appearing in Optimal Transport with Boundary. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Bringing back homogeneity\n",
    "\n",
    "In this repository, we propose a model of regularized (unbalanced) OT that will be homogeneous. \n",
    "The key idea is to slighly modify the entropic regularization term. \n",
    "We propose two formulations, using: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ +\\frac{\\epsilon}{2} \\left( \\mathrm{KL}\\left(\\pi | \\frac{\\alpha}{m(\\alpha)} \\otimes \\beta \\right) + \\mathrm{KL}\\left(\\pi | \\alpha \\otimes \\frac{\\beta}{m(\\beta)} \\right) right) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "or, somewhat more simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ +\\frac{\\epsilon} \\left( \\mathrm{KL}(\\pi | \\frac{\\alpha \\otimes \\beta}{\\sqrt{m(\\alpha)m(\\beta)}} \\right).\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "These models are referred to as *harmonic* and *geometric* homogeneizations as they respectively involve \n",
    "the harmonic and the geometric means of the masses $m(\\alpha),m(\\beta)$ in the computations. \n",
    "They correspond to setting `mode_homogeneity=\"harmonic\"` or `\"geometric\"` in the implementation. \n",
    "Setting `mode_homogeneity=\"std\"` retrieves the standard (non-homogeneous) Unbalanced Regularized OT model. \n",
    "\n",
    "These models are homogeneous by construction. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** In the reference paper, only the harmonic regularization has been studied in depth. \n",
    "Actually, the two models are very similar, the harmonic one presents the advantage of yielding a Sinkhorn divergence \n",
    "that does not need the introduction of a mass bias term. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Other options available\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our implementation was motivated by applications in Topological Data Analysis (TDA). The metrics used in TDA can be \n",
    "cast as problems of *Optimal Transport with Boundary*, a model proposed by Figalli and Gigli. \n",
    "This model correspond to an Unbalanced OT problem involving a *spatially varying* marginal divergence. \n",
    "Adding the standard entropic regularization term (`mode_homogeneity=\"std\"`) to this problem yields highly inhomogeneous \n",
    "behavior, suggesting that using an homogeneous entropic penalty (e.g. `mode_homogeneity=\"harmonic\"`) is much more reliable.\n",
    "This mode is available through the option `mode_divergence=\"boundary\"`. \n",
    "For now, it is restricted to the case where the space is the open half plane $\\Omega = \\{(t_1,t_2),\\ t_1 < t_2\\} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ \n",
    "and its boundary is thus the diagonal $\\partial \\Omega = \\{(t,t),\\ t \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$ (the situation of interest in TDA). \n",
    "Other implementation will be provided in the future. \n",
    "- We propose an option `corrected_marginals`. \n",
    "Setting this parameter to `True` changes the marginal terms $D_\\varphi(\\pi_1 | \\alpha)$ and $D_\\varphi(\\pi_2 | \\beta)$ \n",
    "to $D_\\varphi\\left(\\pi_1 | \\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{m(\\beta)}{m(\\alpha)}}\\right)$ and \n",
    "$D_\\varphi\\left(\\pi_2 | \\beta \\sqrt{\\frac{m(\\alpha)}{m(\\beta)}}\\right)$ \n",
    "respectively. \n",
    "The idea being that, in any case, if $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ have different total masses, it is pointless to expect the \n",
    "marginals $\\pi_1,\\pi_2$ of $\\pi$ to equal $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ ($\\pi_1$ and $\\pi_2$ have the same total masses). \n",
    "Thus, the standard marginals constraints are somewhat \"in contradiction\", and it may be interesting to replace them by \n",
    "more feasible constraints: the measures proposed above have the same total mass, namely $\\sqrt{m(\\alpha)m(\\beta)}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This approach has not been detailed in the reference paper. Actually, it is very similar to compute \n",
    "$\\sqrt{m(\\alpha) m(\\beta)} \\cdot \\mathrm{OT}_{\\epsilon,\\varphi}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{m(\\alpha)}, \\frac{\\beta}{m(\\beta)} \\right)$. "
